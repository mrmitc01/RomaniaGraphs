RomaniaGraphs

This code is used to implement the Breadth First Search, Dijkstra's, and Prim's algorithms using two datasets on Romanian cities

The purposes of each of the following files are stated below:


romaniaGraphs.py - to output the given graph from RomaniaVerticies.txt and RomaniaEdges.txt as an adjacency list, the results of
                   using the Breadth First Search algorithm on three different paths, the results of using Dijkstra's algorithm
                   on one path, and the results of using Prim's algorithm

data - a folder containing the two datasets on Romanian cities: 
  - RomaniaEdges.txt  (a comma separated text file in which each row represents a different edge. The first two entries on a row
                       represent the two vertices connected by the edge, and the last element in the row is the weight associated 
                       with that edge)
  - RomaniaVerticies.txt  (contains the name of every vertex in the graph; each vertex name is on its own line)


Compile the source code by typing the following at the prompt $:

$ python romaniaGraphs.py
